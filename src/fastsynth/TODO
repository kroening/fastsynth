The following expressions are not supported:
sign_extend
extract
distinct
bvsmod
bitvector constants of the form (_bvX n) where X is the value of the bitvector, in decimal i think, and n is the size of the bitvector, e.g., "(_ bv0 24)???

----
There is also a problem with divide by zero:

(set-logic QF_BV)

;;;; division by zero evaluates to all ones.
(assert (= #b0 (bvudiv #b1 #b0)))

(check-sat)
(exit)

invariant violation: File smt2_parser.cpp function expression line 427

---------------

And there is a problem with let parsing. But it only occurs in massive files, e.g.,
/2017-BuchwaldFried/counterexample.dump.ia32_Mul_base_disp--Add32.load32.Mul32.Mulh_u32.0005.smt2
